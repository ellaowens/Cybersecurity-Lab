<h1 align="center">Cybersecurity Lab:</h1>

One of my many projects with TKH was to create a Cybersecurity Lab. For this lab I applied the technical skills ((Linux Terminal Operations, Networking Fundamentals, and Cybersecurity Concepts and Tools) that I learned.   

I created a network diagram using Cisco Packet Tracer, a security lab on VirtualBox, and wrote a paper discussing and describing the various cybersecurity components that made up my security lab.

<h3 align="center">My paper explains what tools and services make my security lab, what they do, and why they are important in the security industry.</h3>

#### Here's a snippet of the paper:
